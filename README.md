# Neural_Networks
This workbook is regarding the python implementaion of 2 layered **Neural Networks** for 2 major supervised learnings that is Regression and Classification with **5 fold Cross Validation** without the scikit-learn library.

**1. Non-Linear Regression**<br>
**2. Non-Linear Logistic Regression**

Both were performed performed and compared on 3 different **Activation Functions**:

**1. Hyperbolic Tangent**<br>
**2. Sigmoid Function**<br>
**3. ReLu function**
